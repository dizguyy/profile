    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> I first started my web development journey as a student at Bowie State University. After persuing a Computer Science degree for a couple of years, I realized that the university didn't have the major that I was actually interested in, which was web development. And so, I looked up coding bootcamps, analyzed them, and saw concluded that Thinkful was the best fit for my career goals. </p>

    <p> I realized my love for web development when I found myself being mesmerized by websites with cool looking UI and asking myself, "how can I do that?" I find myself curiously going from website to website implementing cool features that I see into my own websites that I use for practice. What I love even more are the websites that are constantly being worked on by a team and seeing different peoples input on a certain aspect of said website. </p>


    <p> A couple of things that i'm interested in outside if web development includes: </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Video Games </li>
      <li> Anime </li>
      <li> Playing the bass </li>
    </ul>
